PlanetaryVRMLs
==============

VRMLs I have created in support of planetary science


###BeltonCospar


###Hartley2Rotations


###HartleyFlyby


###Lightcurve9P


###NextFlyby

Final simulation of Stardust/NExT flyby of comet 9P/Tempel 1, finalized one day before the flyby on 14.Feb, 2011.
Includes rotation of image due to mirror rotation.  
An earlier version of this VRML was used to set the Time Of Arrival (TOA) Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) on year
earlier; the goal of the TCM was to arrive at the comet and be able to view a lit impact site as created by the Deep Impact
mission in 2005.
